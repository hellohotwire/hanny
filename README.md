# Hanny 

[hellohotwire.com](https://hellohotwire.com)

Hanny is a Hotwire-enabled Ruby on Rails application inspired by canny.io. This build-along aims to recreate similar features you might find in that application. 

Get ready to explore powerful features like feature voting, feature filtering, user comments, search, and more. Weâ€™ll harness the full potential of Hotwire and other Ruby on Rails framework features to create real-time interactions, empowering you to build robust applications without relying heavily on JavaScript frameworks.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo down.
2. Run `bundle install` and `yarn install`.
3. `./bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`


Git branches on the repo pertain to each lesson in the build-along. Follow my lead in the videos as we navigate together on [hellohotwire.com](https://hellohotwire.com)
